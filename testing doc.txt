I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.

https://github.com/abromile/BowlingGame

As of right now, the system acts as a single-lane, text-based game.
The user inputs their bowling score for each turn, can add and 
remove players from the lane, and edit throws on the board.

This should be started from the Lane class and all java files should 
be in the same package.

There are JUnit tests for the Player and PlayerManager classes.
They test that all of their methods return the correct output for
a given set of inputs.


Below is a brief summary of all the testing and checks we have done
outside of doing JUnit tests.

MAIN MENU
-user enters 'q': should quit the program
-user enters 's': should begin game and prompt for a name

NAME INPUT
-name the user enters should be 10 characters or less, otherwise it
will prompt for name over and over until they do it right. Names
with spaces are allowed. This also applies to adding a new player
or changing a players name.

START MENU
-inputting anything not in the menu will tell you an error and bring 
you back to the game
-user enters 'b': should take you back to game

NOTE: for the menu functions, we still need to add try/catch blocks
for if they enter a string when asked for a number

ADD PLAYER
-won't add a player if you are already at capacity
-checks name

REMOVE PLAYER
-won't remove a player if you only have one player
-checks that you input a correct player number

EDIT THROW
-checks that you input a correct player number
-checks that you input a correct frame
-does not yet check for inserting a valid number for the throw

EDIT PLAYER NAME
-checks for correct name format
-checks that you input a correct player number

LANE CLASS
-there is error checking for each throw to make sure the user enters
a valid throw. i.e. first throw is a number 0-10, the two throws in
the frame add up to 10, they did not input a string, etc.

BOARD CLASS
-should print / for spares and X for strikes
-prints board in proper format for each player with total score at
the end
